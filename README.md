# Thermochemistry analysis tools

This repository contains a set of Python scripts for post processing of Gaussian quantum chemistry simulation outputs as well as some other useful functionality such as creating input files and running equilibrium calculations.

This code is no longer actively developed. It should be turned into a package if used in the future.
